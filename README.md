GJS Calculator
==============

This simple calculator project was generated by Briefcase (part of Beeware),
and then app.py was heavily modified to create a calculator.

Currently, it is hard-wired for Gtk (aka Linux). Other platforms are an
exercise left for the reader (some specific access to Gtk widgets could
be made optional, and/or otherwise cross-platform replacement code).
